# Groundhog
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spgroup/groundhog.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spgroup/groundhog)

A Java project to crawl raw GitHub data and to extract metrics from it

## Usage

Groundhog uses Java 7 features, so you must have it installed before build.

### Building in your machine

Groundhog was built using Maven, so to build the project you will need to run the tool and let it fetch all the dependencies:

```
$ mvn package
```

### Bulding for Eclipse

In order for it to behave like an Eclipse project, you'll need to install the Maven plugin and then run:

```
$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
```

### Generating the JAR

Generate the JAR file for the Groundhog project.

Eclipse users can go to `File > Export > Runnable Jar File` and enter the `CmdMain` class for the option "Launch Configuration".

### Running Groundhog

Search GitHub for projects matching "phonegap-facebook-plugin" and place the results (if any) in a folder called metrics:

```shell
$ java -jar groundhog.jar -forge github -out metrics phonegap-facebook-plugin
```

### Running tests

```
$ mvn test
```
