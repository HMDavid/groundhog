# Groundhog

A simple pure Java tool to crawl Java projects from popular forges and to extract metrics from them.

## Usage

### Building in your machine

Groundhog was built using Maven. In order for it to behave like an Eclipse project, you'll need to install [1] Maven, and then run:

```
$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
```

### Generating the JAR

Generate the JAR file for the Groundhog project. Eclipse users can go to `File > Export > Runnable Jar File` and enter the `CmdMain` class for the option "Launch Configuration".

### Running Groundhog

Search GitHub for projects matching "phonegap-facebook-plugin" and place the results (if any) in a folder called metrics:

```shell
$ java -jar groundhog.jar -forge github -out metrics phonegap-facebook-plugin
```
